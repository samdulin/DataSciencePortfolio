# Data Science Portfolio for Sam Dulin

This Portfolio is a sample of projects I have done for data analysis and exploring machine learning algorithms. They are a mixture of Python, R, and MATLAB. 

## Projects in R

### Filling in Missing Values in Datasets
[GitHub](/RProjects/missingValues.md)

One common problem in biological datasets is that of having missing values. In particular, humans have a lot of trouble determing bird sex. So, I tasked myself with creating a classifier and using feature extraction to be able to predict bird sex. The algorithm outperformed random assignement by a factor greater than 10 in most cases.

### Statistical Study of Infant Mortality Death in NYC
[GitHub](/RProjects/InfantMortalityStudy.md)

This dataset is infant mortality death collected for the years 2007-2016 in New York City. I analyze the relationship between race and infant mortality rate using various statistical visaulizations. I also explore the relationship between the type of infant death and race using a chi-square test.

## Project in Python

## Deep Learning for Forest Fire Prediction
