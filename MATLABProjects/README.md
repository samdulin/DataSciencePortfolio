The algorithm used here is based on the work of Cui, Dieci, and Zhao in their paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09502.pdf. Many thanks to them for their guidance and support. This code was a joint effort with Scott McIntyre.

If we have a pile of sand, what is the most efficient way to move that sand so as to make a sand castle? The 'optimal transport' is the answer to that problem. One way to find this optimal transport is actually by solving a partial differental equation (https://www.iap.fr/actualites/laune/2022/TransportOptimal/ark%20_67375_VQC-XB4DR0Z3-2.pdf). 

An example of an optimal transport is below. It is a tranport between two normal distributions with different mean and standard deviation parameters.
